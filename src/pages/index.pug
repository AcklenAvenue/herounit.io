			p Byron Sommardahl, the founder of HeroUnit, has lived with one foot in Nashville, TN and another foot in Honduras since 2010. Byron and his partners at Acklen Avenue Software discovered immense and mostly unnoticed technical talent in Latin America and especially in Honduras! That talent is what drives both Acklen Avenue and HeroUnit today.
			p Honduras and Nashville are in the same time-zone and is just about 4 hours away by plane, these are some of the facts that help us keep our business growing up together with satisfied clients since 2010!
